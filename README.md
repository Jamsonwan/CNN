# CNN model

Implement convolution neuron network step by step, which you can use conveniently by changing a few of parameters. Fllowing by parameters instructions:

    train_path : the train data file path, which is form of .h5
    test_path: the test data file path

    conv_layers: convolution kernel, each kernel with shape of [height, weight, in_channels, out_channels]
    pool_stride: the stride of max-pooling, each stride with shape of [1, size, size, 1]
    ksize: the size of max-pool filter, each filter with shape of [1, size, size, 1]
